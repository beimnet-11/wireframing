## Key Elements of a Wireframe

Wireframes are skeletal blueprints of a website or application that outline its structure and functionality. The key elements of a wireframe include:

- **Layout Structure**  
  Defines the arrangement of elements on the page, including headers, footers, sidebars, and content areas.  
  *Example:* A two-column layout for a property listing page, with images on the left and booking details on the right, helps users navigate information efficiently.

- **Navigation**  
  Represents menus, links, and buttons that allow users to move through the site or application.
  ## Types of Wireframes

Wireframes can be categorized based on their level of detail and fidelity:

- **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**  
  - Simple sketches or basic digital layouts that focus on the overall structure and placement of elements rather than visual details.  
  - Typically used in the **early stages** of design to brainstorm ideas, explore layouts, and communicate concepts quickly
