## Key Elements of a Wireframe

Wireframes are skeletal blueprints of a website or application that outline its structure and functionality. The key elements of a wireframe include:

- **Layout Structure**  
  Defines the arrangement of elements on the page, including headers, footers, sidebars, and content areas.  
  *Example:* A two-column layout for a property listing page, with images on the left and booking details on the right, helps users navigate information efficiently.

- **Navigation**  
  Represents menus, links, and buttons that allow users to move through the site or application.
